# Installation

```
$ python -m venv local
$ ./local/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
$ ./local/bin/python app.py
```

The app uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and can only be run with python < 3.8.

# Vizualizing self-attention in a file

the files are hard-coded (for the moment). The self-attention weights have to be dumped from `joeynmt`.
